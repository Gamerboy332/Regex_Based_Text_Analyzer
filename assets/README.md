Assets folder

Put visual design files here. These files are intended as reference only and are not required for the application to run.

Recommended filename for the mockup provided during the issue: `design_reference.png`.

This folder can contain:
- design_reference.png (UI mockup)
- exported screenshots
- icons used by the UI

Tip: If you want to keep the assets out of version control, add `assets/` to `.gitignore`.
